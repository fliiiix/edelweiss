# edelweiss

edelweiss, `/ËˆeÉªdÉ™lvaÉªs/`. A de**light**ful color scheme for my personal terminal stack.

<img align="right" width="50%" src="assets/logo_v1.png" />

edelweiss currently supports:

- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) - *The fast, feature-rich, CPU based terminal emulator.*
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/) - *Hyperextensible Vim-based text editor.*
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) - *terminal multiplexer*.
- [k9s](https://k9scli.io/) - *Kubernetes CLI to manage your clusters in style.*
